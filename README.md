## Motivation

Notes started off just like any other project, just an idea. As I gave it more thought I decided I wanted to create an application that had users and user data. Notes allows to demonstrate that I'm able to understand how a full-stack application is built.


## Challenges
Some of the challenges I faced were:
- thinking of how the notes were going to relate to the users
- working with MongoDB because it was my first time using it (lots of googling and documentation)
- Handling the authentication instead of using a library

## Tech Stack

- Front-end: JavaScript, React, TailWindCSS, React-Router-DOM, React-modal
- Back-end: JavaScript, Node, Express, Mongoose, Bcrypt, CORS

### Database

- MongoDB
